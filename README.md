# 500 Stars
A repo where I'll work towards collecting all 500 stars in Advent of Code, with the eventual goal a sub 1 second total runtime.
Most of the code layout, tests, and benchmarks is taken directly from [here](https://github.com/maneatingape/advent-of-code-rust/tree/main), with many thanks to maneatingape.
